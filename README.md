## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

<b>Advanced CSS Techniques:</b>
<p>I want to explore more advanced pseudo-selectors and combinators. I also aim to learn about CSS Grid and Flexbox to handle more complex layouts.</p>

<b>JavaScript Enhancements:</b>
<p>I plan to practice handling different user inputs and validation scenarios. I want to refine my understanding of JavaScript events and form handling.</p>

<b>Accessibility Improvements:</b>
<p>I need to ensure that my forms and interactive elements are accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.</p>

<b>Responsive Design:</b>
<p>Iâ€™ll work on making my designs responsive to different screen sizes and devices.</p>
